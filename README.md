I am an eager learner who loves to solve problems. Whether the problem is simple or difficult I often always try and make sure that it is solved. I have a bachelor's in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from S.I.E.S Graduate School Of Technology(Navi Mumbai) and throughout my career I have been driven by my intellectual curiosity to find answers to the most obfuscating questions and problems.

I have a keen and profound interest in Robotics. I always been always driven by the thoughts of different types of Robots which I find fascinating and interesting. I like to innovate and make different types of Robots and systems that thrive to make human lives easier. Throughout my 4 years of engineering I have made Tons of Projects and Gadgets with my innovating skill and deep knowledge in subject.

My this keen interest also drives me towards becoming lifelong learner and versatile in building different projects. I am a scrupulous person who tends to work unless its completed. I make decisions by logic and not by emotions :)   <img align="right" width="400" height="400" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a0/3a/56/a03a56f4feaa8eb194117b5d0d926109.gif">
